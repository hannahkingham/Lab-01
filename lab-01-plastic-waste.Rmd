### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
# Do not edit this code chunk!
library(tidyverse) 
```

```{r load-data, message=FALSE}
# Do not edit this code chunk!
plastic_waste <- read_csv("data/plastic-waste.csv")
```

### Exercise 1
```{r plastic-waste-hist}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2)

plastic_waste %>%
filter(plastic_waste_per_cap > 3.5)
```
### Exercise 2

```{r plastic-waste-density}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, aes(x = plastic_waste_per_cap, 
          color = continent, 
          fill =  continent,)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)
```

### Exercise 3

We want color and fill to be applied to one variable so we map them to aes but we want alpha to be applied to the overall aes of the plot so we plot it to geom (alpha also just refers to the opacity of a geom, where the lower values correspond to more transparent colors).

### Exercise 4

Violin plots are very similar to boxplots with the exception that they show the density of the variable. With the density information, violin plots reveal the structure in the data while a boxplot does not and this makes violin plots overall better (provided you have enough data to estimate the density).

As for the features apparent in the boxplot and not in the violin plot - violin plots are potentially misleading for smaller sample sizes, where the density plots can appear to show interesting features. Box plots provide a coarser summary of the data, they seem safer to use with smaller samples. For very small sample sizes, violin plots provide no direct indication that the sample is very small, worsening the above problem.

The violin plots, plotted by the code below, don't show the summary statistics such as the median, IQR etc.

```{r plastic-waste-violin}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste, 
       mapping = aes(x = continent, 
                     y = plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
  geom_violin(trim=FALSE)
```

### Exercise 5

From this plot, the trend seems to be that as plastic waste per capita increases, the mismanaged plastic waste per capita also increases. There are both large and small increases in the mismanaged waste but in general, it still increases.

```{r plastic-waste-mismanaged}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste,
       mapping = aes(
         x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
         y = mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap)) +
geom_point()

```

### Exercise 6

There doesnt seem to be any clear trend between continents and mismanaged plastic waste. Africa seems to have a linear, rapidly increasing, trend when just considering one continent

```{r plastic-waste-mismanaged-continent}
ggplot(data = plastic_waste,
       mapping = aes(
         x = plastic_waste_per_cap,
         y = mismanaged_plastic_waste_per_cap,
         colour = continent)) +
geom_point()
```
